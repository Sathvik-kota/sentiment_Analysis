0,"Amazon should apologize for Kindle delays over Christmas!!!

With all the hype about ordering Kindle for the holidays I ordered early - in November, figuring I'd give it a shot despite the high price and semi-negative feedback. So, imagine my dismay with a week to go before Christmas - and not only has the thing never shipped - I now get a little cheerful snowflake-clad announcement that it won't even arrive until AFTER Christmas! A MONTH AFTER I ORDERED IT! Maybe Amazon shouldn't be hyping their products if they can't build enough of them to deliver for the holidays. Maybe they should put their current ads on hiatus until they can at least fill their back orders. I am VERY disappointed. At this cost point, had I known that the product would not reach me by the holidays, I would have simply purchased something else.Shame on you, Amazon!",negative
0,"Not Funny Enough

This book is supposed to be funny; however, it isn't funny enough to justify its price. The book uses word phrases and plays on words to try and attempt its humor. It fails in every respect. Dont' get me wrong, there are a FEW funny parts to the book, but it simply repeats the same joke (using new words) over and over. Thus, it isn't funny enough. Don't buy it.",negative

1,"I am not an expert in management...

but my manager recommended this book to me and I loved it! I have been working in retail management for over 5 years, and it was so refreshing to find a management book that I could actually relate to, and I could understand. So many business books detail plans to drive sales, or improve numbers, and this one helps to focus in on keeping employees and raising your potential. I personally feel that this book could apply to all industries and all forms of management, and it is a definite read if you want a different perspective on learning how to be a better manager, and how to run a better business.",positive
0,"Bad Amazon Suggestion

1,"Great movie, more extras please

Wow!! This is a magic movie. I am a Star Wars junkie, but this movie rocks!!! It is better than Jedi and that abomination called the Phantom Menace. The acting performances are top notch, and it is a wonder that Michelle Yeoh and Zhi Ziyang did not get Oscar nominations. It just shows that Hollywood still doesn't appreciate fine acting, and chooses to nominate hacks like Julia Roberts.Anyway, the DVD could use some more extras on it. There is a nice interview with Yeoh and a good single overview of the making of the film, but I would have liked to have seen more about how the story was conceived, other than what we learn in the overview. I did enjoy the part about the music of the film. It was very interesting.All in all, I highly recommend this DVD. The movie is great(watch it in the original Mandorin, not the English dubbed) and the DVD is good. BUY IT NOW!!!!",positive

0,"Don't be fooled!

I read all the 5-star reviews of this book and was convinced it must be a winner, but it is hands-down the most poorly written book I have ever read. It doesn't help that there is no table of contents and no index for quick reference, making it impossible to skim.

Your sitting back, enjoying a hot coffee from a percolator (that's a none-electric coffee maker for you youngsters), sat upon a Tuscan Grill (another Steven Raichlen product to check out) kept hot by smoldering mesquite embers.And to top it all off... a nice iced tea.And for the record...

1,"Beautiful Love Songs

Love songs in a setting by the sea, ALL very BEAUTIFUL. There is somewhat of a contemplative mood to this album. I think that the ""paced"" tempo in some of these selections is meant to evoke the sea through wavelike repetitions, but there is a certain monotony to the album as a whole.My favorites were Melodramma; Mille Lune Mille Onde; Mascagni; Il Mistero Dell' Amore; Se La Gente Usasse Il Cuore; L'Habitudine; Il Diavolo E L'Angelo.L'Habitudine ends as a duet sung with Helena. Prefigures the great Vivere album which contains several stupendous duets.L'Incontro was written by Bocelli about his baby son.An attractive pamphlet comes with the album and contains some nice pictures of Bocelli. It includes English translations of all the songs, for which I was very grateful.There are a few passages where the loudness of the orchestra seems to overwhelm a softness of the voice.",positive

Purchased this newer model to be compatible with my BlackBerry 8830. I've found that this newer model is much clearer than a previous one I owned. It also stays in my ear better - doesn't sag.

1,"Excellent Disney should Make More Like This

Let me start off with saying that Johnny Depp was great in this movie. It had the potential to be horrible but I am glad to own it. I had heard enough praise about it to be confident enough to buy it without seeing it first. This movie had everything that I wanted it to have. Orlando Bloom who I liked already was great and he was played a stupid character but he managed to save the part. Johnny Depp was hilarious with his role as Captain Jack Sparrow. This was Disney's first PG-13 movie in the U.S and I hope not the last. I've grown out of Disney but I was impressed. This is a must see and a must buy.",positive

0,"Worst Game on the PS3

This is the game which destroyed my faith in gaming review websites.First, the good: it has sharp and detailed graphics and well-animated cutscenes.The bad: gameplay is pretty terrible. Yes, there is a CQC mechanic. However, the level design is such that you aren't forced to use it. I ended up running and gunning the entire way through as that was simply the quickest way to make it. the shooter portions are pretty bad. Aiming is difficult and movement is choppy.The cutscenes take way too long, and not only that, waste a lot of time on stupid angsty japanese anime cliches about darkness. Also, strip out the cutscenes and the game portion is very short. About 5 hours or so.Boss fights are similarly annoying, as they rely mostly on the bad shooter aspects of the game.I literally fell asleep playing this game. I cannot believe the number of 10's that this game received from review sites. MGS 3 was a much better game all around, it is ridiculous.",negative

Not only does she have a strong middle voice, but she can hit the high operatic notes also. Yes, she sings it all!! I wasn't sure at first it was her until I heard her sing it live and it was amazing. With great remakes like ""My funny Valentine"" and ""How long has this been going on"" you have songs that get stuck in your head, but you also have songs like "" If you hadn't but you did"" which is a great song that is faster which applies to a lot of guys ( not all, but some).

This is the book for you if you are interested in an academic review of several pre-WW2 races featuring Nuvolari. If you want to learn anything about Nuvolari the man, you'll have to look elsewhere.",negative
1,"great

I give this movie 4**** This movie was great you will not be disappointed in watch this film .I'm a zombie movie fan and I haven't seen a movie this good since Dawn of The Dead and of course The walking Dead .I must say that British are really making great zombie movies. I think they need to merge with some of the film maker in the U.S and come up with a great zombie film. Until next time I wilL looking for another zombie file that's worth watching over and over.",positive
1,"cool seat cover

Looks good, easy to install and comfortable fabric. In my case, it's the perfect match for a white car. Can't find it in the stores in my area anymore. Good product.",positive
0,"Waste of Time

This was really bad. Dr. Blair tries to teach you French by putting you in an adventure story. I got this on sale for a few dollars and it wasn't even worth that. If you want to learn French using the auditory method then use Pimsleur or Michel Thomas which are so much better than this product",negative
0,"The music matters

why people would ever buy this album amazes me! The Killers are a decent band.. i guess.. but lets just get this straight, they only have 2 good songs ""Smile Like You Mean It"" and ""Mr. Brightside"" that's essentially all they have to offer, don't buy this album, borrow it then return it the next day.. for your own sake!",negative
1,"Washington from a distance

I liked the very readable style the book is written in. It doesn't get bogged down on minute details but gives the readers an overall picture of Washington, with a heavy focus on his political life.I don't know if this is a result of the records or of the author, since this is my first biography on Washington, but I didn't get a good feel for who Washington was as a person. The book details his actions, but it doesn't let us into his motives and his passions.",positive

Tolkien would have loathed this and everything it stands for. He was a Christian, not a gulliable New Age dimwit. An indefensible rip-off and travesty of the work of a great genius",negative

0,"Shoddy workmanship

I loved the concept of the grill and I managed to convince myself that the fact that burgers and steaks came out really dry meant they were less fatty and therefore healthier. I put up with the price and relative difficulty in locating of replacement bags, chalking it up to the cost of owning a niche item. Then, this week, the knob came right off. It sheared off at its base, rendering the built-in timer totally useless.That's it. After six months, this thing's going out with next week's trash. This could have been a great product but they screwed up too many of the little details.",negative

How can our children be best educated if behavior andlearning styles are sterotyped? No! It's impossible to educate with narrow minded beliefs about our sons and daughters.I home school and my kids do not fit the patterns Guriansets out as ""normal"" In the mix of individuals I have as students,it evens out.Gurian is preachy and arrogant in his views.I have the feeling if you don't believe him then you're less informed or educatedthan he is.Wrong!And the 'bridge brain' is only a disclaimer.Of course you willfind exceptions to his rules,it's called indivdual talent!I can't tell you how many girls I've taught learn by doing.Just as many boys are sitting still and reading.Gurian's books are dangerous to our society.He is selling anidea which will keep children in shackles.Gurian's writings have nothing to do with day to day real life.They have everything to do with sexism and keeping young womenin low paying jobs,self hate and low self esteem.",negative

0,"Nice size, doesn't sparkle

I asked for this ring for my birthday because my friend has the same design and its gorgeous on her. When it arrived, I was extremely disappointed. The sizes of the stones were fine, a little on the small side, but the imperfections were obvious even to my untrained eye. The most disappointing thing was that it just didn't sparkle even in the sunlight. I was wearing a diamond band from Costco and it sparkles beautifully. There was an article on CNN about the differences between purchasing diamonds from Costco & Tiffany's and the conclusion was that you do get quality diamonds from Costco and its well worth it. At least with Costco, you can see the diamonds before hand. I love Amazon but I strongly don't recommend it for jewels. You just don't know what you're getting no matter how many reviews you read.",negative

0,"I don't like it, it worth less than one star.

For a romance fiction, it worth zero star. For a erotic one, it may worth 3 stars. The story plot is simple but ridiculous and unrealistic, even for a erotic fiction, it still should have a reasonable plot. The H/H couldn't resist each other and mating (suck...) in the public area, for one time its still fine for me, but they performed continuously in the public, it is beyond my understanding. The H/H should have psychological problems; they need help from professionals, even though at that time counselling was not common.Besides, the heroin was too submissive and I don't think what she was doing was accepted in the Regency. The physical description of the hero was too unbelievable, and the character of the hero's mother was also ridiculous.Sexy, steamy or even erotic is fine for me, only if it have a reasonable storyline. It was quite surprise to find lots of 5 stars review, may be I expected too much.",negative
0,"Extremely Disappointed

This toy is extremely useless and not worth the money. I bought it for my 3 month old son and he could not even reach the only ""one "" toy that hangs from it. He could not see himself in the mirror and could barely fit under it. It is useless for a baby. My 4 year old actually liked it more because of all the futuristic sounds it makes and balls that can be thrown down a chute, which is all it really does. The commerical makes it seem like a fun toy but it isn't. It was a waste of money and you can't even return it because once it is built it cannot come apart(it says so on the instructions). I guess Fisher Price knew they made a horrible toy and wanted to make sure no one could return it.",negative

Yes, it's not Disney with its flawless animation and elaborate musical numbers. However, my child can't get enough of this video, and for the adults it has a lot of (intentional or not) funny moments with the fairy godmothers, the evil villaness, and the would-be hero prince.The animation reminds me of the Care Bears. It's like the TV-movie version of Sleeping Beauty. Same story, not as sugary-sweet, but entertaining none the less.",positive

This is a good book if you have young children that are anxious about starting school.

Being of a certain age and extremely technology impaired, I was very concerned over my ability to learn how to use the Garmin 320. Much to my surprise, I was able to use it right out of the box. It is very intuitive. My only problem was when I just wanted to enter a city and State. I learned you had to input a street address first. So now I just enter the first address that appears and update it when I arrive near my destination. Love it!",positive
1,"""Cravings"" is the remarkable debut of a fascinating new voice on electric guitar.

Each note is played with care and given its specific emotional meaning. And when VOSS allows himself occassionally to take a light and humorous approach, he does it with maximum style and sophistication: his tricky version of the evergreen ""Guantanamera"" is a fine example of musical wit and impeccable craftsmanship.",positive
