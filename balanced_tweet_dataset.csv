A bunch of horizontal scrolls is not a problem if instead I have to do a bunch of vertical ones. Looks less intuitive to me. And I can use the go-to option, but I kinda already could and never did.

The point is that it ""Requires An Account""! I don't need another stinking account to keep track of a task list. If I wanted to share on multiple devices, I would just use any number of desktop applications that I already own. I don't need another stinking program tracking my business in the sake of ""backing up my data' or make it available everywhere. I have that covered already.  Just wanted a simple task list for a small price to use on my phone. But without that choice, no thanks. To act as though 10 seconds to give up my privacy is no big deal, well my information and data is not your business or any one else unless I decide I want to do that.

349,I've turned off every notification option I can find and I still get pop up reminders on my screen. I just want a silent reminder in my notification bar. Can't tell you how many times a reminder has popped up during a call and I can't press the end button to hang up. Or accidently clicked the reminder while trying to do something else on my phone. Please give an option or tell me where to find it for notifications WITHOUT a popup on the screen that steals focus on whatever I'm working on.,1,neutral

I have the upgraded version.  2. Settings, General, Start with... is set for Day View, but shows month instead.  3. Help & Feedback only gives option to email for help. No option to search for help.  4. When deleting an item in a series comma I do not get the option to just delete the one occurrence.  Am I doing something wrong?

One thing that makes this a 4-star (above average) app rather than 3 (average), is the automatic inclusion of past-due tasks in Today-list. Of course, if it's past due, it has to be due today. Somehow most to-do apps miss this. 5-stars will be when(or if) they actually release the google assistant integration and it actually works without issues. That Zapier-stuff, though.... what a joke. If anyone has the time to deal with that, they have plenty of extra time and have no need for a to-do app. Also, including zapier as a premium feature, with zapier itself requiring an expensive subscription to actually work, is a pretty damn dick move. Yea, just thought about this again, and this dick move costs 1 star. Pay $10 for a 1 star extra DLC!",1,neutral

It does have some short comings that are irritating to me at least. I use my calendar to keep track of my to do lists. I save them in the Description field. First off the editing features such as bolding, underlining, line numbering, etc don't appear anywhere unless like in my case you accidently discover them by doing a couple of steps of bizarre gymnastics. Once found I loved the features. However the first thing that is annoying is that if you have a long list of things that go past one screen you have to keep scrolling down to access those features. Would be nice if there was a button or tab that would open a stationary bar at the top or a floating window that moves with the screen. Second issue is definitely a software bug having to do with the line numbering. Once a line numbering list has been established and you want to go back to add a new line or change the priority by moving things up and down the system does odd things.",1,neutral

one that I can add notes to for phone numbers, first pickup address and 
fare. Most importantly it must sound the notification even if mute is on at 
night and early mornings when ai am asleep. Every one I tried did the first 
two, none did the latter two. This one. It does let me add notes but sadly 
does not make the notification sound when the phone is on silent which is a 
big oversight - so it is of no use to me apart from runs when I am awake.

8220,"Is it true that non-premium version soon will loose any way for backup/restore or transfer to another phone? If not true: Please point to me what is the backup/restore way that stays in app in the future. Thanks a lot!. If true: That is really bad news - backup is a basic necessity, so non-premium version will become practically useless on the long term. In addition, premium costs twice as much for a single year than, let's say OsmAnd+ for eternity. And that is a much more complex app + the free version is completely usable within reasonable limits. Tasks is a really nice app (except that swichingt between sublists/lists is unreasonably slow) with some unique and essential features. But this wracks it, it will drive me away. Possibly others too. Not a fair move to reduce base functionality like that. RESPONSE TO STEVEN NOTTAGE'S RESPONSE: That is fair enough, except for one important detail: all the people using your free app are now forced to decide - if they want to have a meaningful app - to pay or search for another app. Premium app should only add features and not restrict free app's capabilities. If you add worthwhile features with a fair pricing, people will buy it. Lots of people spent time to set up their tasking system because the app had the right properties for them, now it looks like they were lured into using the app and then forcing them to pay. I payed for a number of apps (all cheaper than yours btw.), and actually my plan was to pay/donate as soon as the slowness of switching between task lists disappear, because I thought the app is really useful and it deserves support. This change is different. I do not mean you should not ask for payment for cloud backup etc., just that you should not remove the free local backup (or any other feature). Or that you should have omitted it from the free version from the start. Best wishes! RESPONSE TO STEVEN NOTTAGE'S SECOND RESPONSE: Actually you can clearly see from my review that I do not want everything for free. My problem is different. If we could not understand each other so far, perhaps it's not worth trying any more. So I won't comment on the rest of your answer. All the best!",1,neutral

When I use Wunderlist or Google Tasks or just Alexa by itself, the changes are instantly viewable across all platforms.

Allows for editing one entry of (for example) a weekly appointment, but rather than edit the one instance (as you think you are doing) it creates a new one, so you have a double entry, the original which you can't delete, even after synching. If you've set weekly appointments and one is cancelled, you should be able to edit that one instance without creating a duplicate. I've had this installed for some time now, thinking that the developers would resolve these problems, but although the app has regular 'updates', nothing has changed. Drag and drop defaults to copy, imo should be 'move' by default. If you change an appointment it changes, not duplicates.

All you get is some minuscule, measly bar graphs which are tiny...and get this, they don't even label the metric you're tracking as they are displayed in the order in which your goal list is. So unless you memorize that goal #7 is say exercise daily, you won't even know what you're looking at. Additionally, the streaks are glitchy as hell, and often times do not calculate correctly. Really wish they also had aggregate goals, for example grouping similar goals together and then tracking the success percent for the aggregate. Like say if you have multiple diet goals for no dairy, no gluten, and no sugar, it would be great to group those in the diet category and then see your success there overall and trending graphs. And come on, add some pie charts and the ability to look at graphs in intervals aside from a single month.",1,neutral
